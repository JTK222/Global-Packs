* Again compatible with 1.16.1
+ You can now also add resource packs to your modpacks.
  They'll be force enabled just like datapacks.
  Just create following folder: "global_resource_packs" and throw the resource packs in there.
* The "global_data_pack" folder is now deprecated and will be replaced with "global_data_packs" in 1.17
  You can already rename your folder, but you need to chose which one will be used.
  The new folder will be created by default.
